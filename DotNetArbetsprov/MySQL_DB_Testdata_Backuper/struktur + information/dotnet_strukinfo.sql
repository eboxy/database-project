The groups original lineup consisted of David Gahan (lead vocals), Martin Gore (keyboards, guitar, vocals, chief songwriter after 1981), Andrew Fletcher (keyboards) and Vince Clarke (keyboards, chief songwriter 1980–81). Vince Clarke left the band after the release of their 1981 debut album, and was replaced by Alan Wilder (lead keyboards) who played with the band from 1982 to 1995. Following Wilders departure, Gahan, Gore, and Fletcher have performed as a trio.<br /><br />Depeche Modes origins can be traced back to 1977, when Vince Clarke and Andrew Fletcher formed a band called No Romance In China, with Clarke on vocals/guitar and Fletcher on bass. In 1978, Clarke played guitar in an Ultravox rip-off band, The Plan, with school friend Robert Marlow on vocals and Vince on guitar/keyboards. In 1978–79, Gore played in an acoustic duo, Norman and The Worms, with school friend Philip Burdett (who now sings on the folk circuit) on vocals and Gore on guitar. In 1979, Marlow, Gore, Clarke and friend Paul Redmond formed a band called The French Look, Marlow on vocals/keyboards, Gore on guitar, Clarke and Redmond on keyboards. In March 1980, Clarke, Gore and Fletcher formed a band called Composition of Sound, with Clarke on vocals/guitar, Gore on keyboards and Fletcher on bass. The French Look and Composition of Sound once played live together in June 1980 at St. Nicholas School Youth Club in Southend-on-Sea, Essex.<br /><br />During the touring and promotion for Speak & Spell, Clarke began to privately voice his discomfort at the direction the band was taking. He later expressed his agitation that there was never enough time to do anything. In late 1981, Clarke publicly announced that he was leaving Depeche Mode. Soon afterwards, he joined with blues singer Alison Moyet to form Yazoo (Yaz in the US) and later, the duo Erasure with Andy Bell, in 1985. With their primary songwriter gone, Depeche Mode needed a new direction. Martin Gore, who had written Tora! Tora! Tora! and Big Muff for their debut album, took over as the bands new songwriter. In January 1982, the band released See You, their first single without Clarke, which against all expectations, managed to beat all three Clarke-penned singles in the UK charts, reaching #6. In the ensuing months of that year, two more singles were released (The Meaning of Love, and Leave in Silence), and the band embarked on their first world tour - known as the See You tour. Their second album A Broken Frame was eventually brought out in September.<br /><br />During the early stages of recording for A Broken Frame, the band recognised that it needed a fourth member for touring and other commitments. In late 1981, they placed an ad in Melody Maker stating Keyboard player needed for established band - no timewasters. Alan Wilder, a 22-year old keyboardist from West London responded - and after two auditions with Daniel Miller, he was accepted as the fourth member of Depeche Mode. Despite this, Daniel Miller informed Wilder that he was not needed for the recording of the album, as the band wanted to prove that they could succeed without Vince Clarke. Wilders first musical contribution to the band was in 1983, on the non-album single Get the Balance Right!.<br /><br />1987s Music for the Masses saw further alterations in the bands sound and working methods. Dave Bascombe (who had previously worked with Tears for Fears) was brought in as a producer (although his role ended up being more that of an engineer),and the band (for the most part) abandoned sampling in favour of more musical experimentation. Although the chart performance of the singles (Strangelove, Never Let Me Down Again and Behind the Wheel) was disappointing in Great Britain (whereas those singles were big hits in countries such as Canada, West Germany, South Africa, Sweden or Switzerland, reaching the Top 10 there), the album was almost universally praised by the music press - far more so than any other album the band had released. Record Mirror described it as the most accomplished and sexy Mode album to date. and it made a breakthrough in the American market, something which the band had failed to achieve with their previous albums.<br /><br />In 1991 Depeche Mode made a one-off contribution to the Wim Wenders film, Until the End of the World, entitled Deaths Door and a third solo album was released by Alan Wilder under the Recoil moniker bridged the gap between albums.<br /><br />On April 3, 2006, remastered editions of Speak & Spell, Music for the Masses, and Violator were released, featuring remastered audio in two-channel stereo and 5.1 multichannel on Super Audio CD and DVD, extra tracks and B-sides. In addition, each album comes with its own documentary charting the history of the band and the production of each album. The second installment of remastered albums were A Broken Frame, Some Great Reward and Songs of Faith and Devotion, all of which were released on October 2, 2006. Construction Time Again and Black Celebration were released on March 26, 2007. Both Ultra and Exciter were released on October 1, 2007.<br /><br /></body></html> '),(2,0,'Einsturzende Neubauten','1980','active','de','Berlin','Industri','<html><body><br /><img class=dyn_pic src=bandbilder/neubauten.gif /> <br /><b>Hemsida:</b><br /><a href=http://www.neubauten.org>Einsturzende Neubauten</a><br /><br /><b>Einsturzende Neubauten</b><br />Theoretically seen Einsturzende Neubautens agenda can be summed up as noise-therapy. In actuality, however they always were and will be exceedingly complex. They are an allegedly chaotic production collective creating music whose particular allure and beauty is in no way obvious upon simple, first time listening. In this music the parameters of conventional music have been entirely shifted. The scale of all aesthetic units involved apparently reach up into infinity and are being constantly collectively redefined.<br /><br />The Berlin Wall was of crucial importance to the founding of Einsturzende Neubauten. The Wall encircling West Berlin transformed that city into astate-subsidized near-paradisiacal freak-enclave for artists and the maladjusted of every sort including Blixa Bargeld, N.U. Unruh and FM Einheit. The trio declared war on every conventional way of listening with the release of their debut-album Kollaps in November 1981. In grey time in which normalcy included the threat that minor incidents in the ongoing Cold War could at any time develop into a Third World War, Einsturzende Neubauten reacted with almost un-listenable cathartic cascades of noise.<br /><br />This was their reaction to the omnipresent political madness and the ever-increasing flood of meaningless pop-songs on radio and TV propagated by the Neue Deutsche Welle scene. Einsturzende Neubauten offered the anxiety ridden, paralyzed and media sedated masses noise-mighty, rhythm-ritualistic anti-Pop as an antidote, made by instruments carefully stolen from building sites, junkyards and Do-It-Yourself-Hardware stores. They employed steel parts, tin drums, drills, hammers, saws and an untuned electric guitar, all crowned by Bargelds bloodcurdling screams und feverish apocalyptic texts. Kollaps, with its atonal essence, embodied exactly what the title suggested: decay and destruction, illness, doom and death. Ironically its release had the exact opposite effect, being the dawning and cornerstone of a completely new understanding of music which came to influence countless popular bands including Depeche Mode, Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson and Rammstein.<br /><br />In the years following, the three founders recruited Alexander Hacke and Marc Chung and expanded their ground-breaking sound field experiments with recordings like Zeichnungen des Patienten O.T. (1983), Halber Mensch (1985), Fünf auf der nach oben offenen Richterskala (1987) and Haus der Lüge (1989), all milestones of the Industrial genre. On their first few albums they were not content to merely widen horizons - they blew em to bits! Pieces like Armenia, Yü-Gung (Fütter mein Ego), Z.N.S. or Feurio! have influenced several generations of individualists who hold themselves aloof from the predetermined apathy of society. Einsturzende Neubautens early repertoire still provides oft-copied blueprints for current experimental sound-and-performance art. As the group continued to broaden the spectrum of musical sound in every imaginable direction, they moved away from the brutal, amphetamine-induced anger of their early days towards an acoustic-amplified oeuvre in which Blixa Bargelds sung and spoken words and accompanying sonic materials formed a distinctly unified whole; their use of eruptive noise became increasingly frugal, being interjected strategically in a nearly mathematical manner. Song structures converged with more conventional patterns of writing. Smiled at in the beginning as a bizarre Mauerstadt curiosity, Einsturzende Neubauten established themselv	es as an irreplaceable variable in contemporary pop-culture.<br /><br />After experiences with large-scale theater-projects working together with renowned directors like Peter Zadek, Heiner Müller and Leander Haussmann - all enthusiastically received by the European critical community -- Einsturzende Neubauten opened another chapter in their musical history with Tabula Rasa (1993), Ende Neu (1996), Silence Is Sexy (2000) and Perpetuum Mobile (2004). This work focuses on the inter-relationship between between loud and quiet, noise and harmony taken to the very limit of the frequency-band spectrum. Carried by treacherous perforated calm and softness, the chief ideologist Blixa Bargeld proves himself to be at the height of his lyrical art with songs such as Die Interimsliebenden, Stella Maris or Die Befindlichkeit des Landes: here, he is hedged in, thinking around corners and edges, pondering.<br /><br />Today, Einsturzende Neubauten is the first and only band which successfully uses the Internet productively to gather and concentrate activities of their fans from around the world. Einsturzende Neubauten launched their official website www.neubauten.org in 2002, and made it the center of their musical activities. Entire albums are financed by registered Supporters via subscription. The principle is simple: their Supporters buy the next Einsturzende Neubauten album before its recorded. With this funding in hand the band has time to work in peace rather than wasting time and energy in endless discussions with record companies about marketing and brand identity - irksome intrusions into the artistic process! In return Supporters world-wide have exclusive access to Einsturzende Neubautens internal working processes.<br /><br />he untiring exploring spirit is still driven by a hot burning desire. Einsturzende Neubauten are still on the unending quest for theundiscovered Sound and have once again perceptibly redefined their parameters.<br /><br />For every generation its own sickness, and for every generation its own cure. Sometimes the proven householdremedies are the most effective.

In 1982, Patrick Codenys - keyboards and Jean-Luc De Meyer - vocals join Front 242 and they release the single \"U-Men\" followed by the first full-length album \"Geography\". This album already displayed the cold, synthetic brand of dance music that would become Front 242\'s signature sound in the following years. In 1983, Dirk Bergen left and Richard 23 joined the band as stage performer and vocalist. <br /><br />The band created its own label , and the organization which promoted music from Belgium. 1983 saw the release of an EP \"Endless Riddance\" and the re-release of the first two singles under the title \"Two-In-One\". The band developed and quickly reached a specialised audience in Europe. <br /><br />With the second full-length album \"No Comment\" in 1984 the term surfaced to describe the synthetic and physically charged qualities of Front 242\'s music and sounds recycled from the media and television. <br /><br />In 1985, the fabulous \"Politics Of Pressure\" was released on 24 track. That year, the band played for the first time in large European festivals and flew to the U.S.A. for some live performances. They were soon tagged as a very powerful live group. <br /><br />The international breakthrough came in 1987 following the signing to Wax Trax in theUnited States and Red Rhino in Europe with the release of the single \"Interception\" and the albums \"Backcatalogue\" and \"Official Version\". This album had a busier sound picture in contrast to the minimalism of the first two studio albums. <br /><br />In 1988, Front 242 released the groundbreaking album \"Front by Front\", taking their sound to its logical extreme. Preceded by the dance-club hit single \"Headhunter\" and its prize-winning video directed by Anton Corbijn, \"Front By Front\" was the band\'s most streamlined and dance-oriented release, with an index/bpm chart displayed on the sleeve for DJ convenience. This release firmly placed the group as a major driving force of electronic music.<br /><br />For their next album release \"Tyranny >For You<\" in 1991, Front 242 was approached by Epic Records U.S. In the next two years Epic did not only release \"Tyranny >For You<\", but also the entire back catalogue with additional material and new covers. Two different versions of \"Tragedy >For You<\" were lifted from the album. For the first time Front 242 was remixed by other bands: The Orb and Prodigy. The sound of these singles differed somewhat from Front 242\'s previous releases. The Orb and Prodigy brought a richer and more varied sound.<br /><br/> Recent years have seen the members of Front 242 taking a break to pursue various solo projects.<br /><br /></body></html> '),(4,0,'Kraftwerk','1970','active','de','Dusseldorf','Synthpop','<html><body><br /><img class=dyn_pic src=bandbilder/kraftwerk.gif /><br /><b>Hemsida:</b><br /><a href=http://www.kraftwerk.com>Kraftwerk</a><br /><br /><b>Kraftwerk</b><br />During the mid-70s, Germanys Kraftwerk established the sonic blueprint followed by an extraordinary number of artists in the decades to come. From the British new romantic movement to hip-hop to techno, the groups self-described robot pop -- hypnotically minimal, obliquely rhythmic music performed solely via electronic means -- resonates in virtually every new development to impact the contemporary pop scene of the late- 20th century, and as pioneers of the electronic music form, their enduring influence cannot be overstated. Kraftwerk emerged from the same German experimental music community of the late 60s which also spawned Can and Tangerine Dream; primary members Florian Schneider and Ralf Hütter first met as classical music students at the Dusseldorf Conservatory, originally teaming in the groupOrganisation and issuing a 1970 album, Tone Float. Schneider and Hütter soon disbanded Organisation, re-christening themselves Kraftwerk (German for power station), beginning work on their own studio (later dubbed Kling Klang), and immersing their music in the fledgling world of minimalist electronics; their 1971 debut, titled simply Kraftwerk 1, offered a hint of their unique aesthetic in its earliest form, already implementing innovations including Schneiders attempts at designing homemade rhythm machines. <br /><br />A series of lineup shifts followed, and at one point Hütter even left the group; however, by the release of 1972s Kraftwerk 2, he and Schneider were again working in tandem. Recorded without a live drummer, the albums rhythms relied solely on a drum machine, creating a distinctly robotic feel without precedent -- the concept of purely technological music was, at the time, utterly alien to most musicians, as well as listeners. A series of well-received live performances followed before Kraftwerk began work on their breakthrough third LP, 1973s Ralf and Florian; honing their many ambitions down to a few simple yet extraordinarily innovative concepts, their music began growing more and more revelatory -- even their clean-cut, scientific image was in direct opposition to the dominant pop fashions of the time. Kraftwerks first album to be issued in the U.S., 1974s Autobahn was an international smash; an edited single version of the epic title track was a major hit at home and abroad, andin America the previously unknown group reached the upper rungs of the pop albums chart. Performed in large part on a Moog synthesizer, Autobahncrystallized the distinctive Kraftwerk sound while making the groups first clear overtures towards conventional pop structure and melody, establishing a permanent foothold for electronic music within the mainstream. <br /><br />Kraftwerk resurfaced in 1975 with Radio-Activity, a concept album exploring the theme of radio communication; indicative of the groups new global popularity, it was released in both German and English-language editions, the latter appearing early the following year. Train travel emerged as the subject of 1977s Trans-Europe Express, which marked an increased movement towards seeming musical mechanization; the line became even further blurred with the follow-up, 1978s aptly titled The Man Machine, a work almost completely bereft of human touches. By this time, the members of Kraftwerk even publicly portrayed themselves as automatons, an image solidified by tracks like We Are the Robots. Having reached the peak of their influence, however, the group disappeared from view, the first of many extended absences to follow; they did not return to action prior to 1981s Computer World, a meditation on the new global dominance of technology -- a society their music long ago predicted and pre-dated. After topping the British charts with the single Computer Love, Kraftwerk again vanished, enjoying a five-year layoff culminating in the release of 1986s Electric Cafe. By now, however, pop music was dominated by synthesizers and drum machines, and the groups stature flagged; but for a 1991 best-of collection titled The Mix, they remained silent during most of the decade. They finally released a new single, Expo 2000, in late 1999, and surprised fans by announcing tour dates. On the recording front, Kraftwerk celebrated the centennial anniversary of the Tour de France with a new version of their 1983 single Tour de France, and followed with a full album (Tour de France Soundtracks) in August 2003. The live record Minimum-Maximum followed in 2005.<br /><br /></body></html> '),(5,0,'Yazoo','1982','1983','uk','Basildon','Synthpop','<html><body><br /><img class=dyn_pic src=bandbilder/Yazoo.gif /><br /><b>Hemsida:</b><br/><a href=http://www.yazoo.org.uk>Yazoo</a><br /><br /><b>Yazoo</b><br />As founder member and main songwriter for Depeche Mode, Vince Clarke had already made his mark with such classic pop songs as New Life and Just Cant Get Enough, yet arguably it was with his next band that he firmly worked his way deep into the living rooms of Britain. Departing from Depeche Mode swiftly after the release of their 1981 debut album Speak And Spell, Yazoo were formed in 1982 when Clarke replied to an advertisement placed by Alison Moyet in the Melody Maker, looking for rootsy blues musicians.<br /><br />Though the pair were a seemingly unlikely combination, any doubters were soon forced to eat their words when their first offering hit the shops in May 1982. Featuring Moyets gorgeous soulful lament layered over Clarkes trademark synth melodies, Only You was a fine weave of heart tugging techno-blues; the fusion was addictive. Yet it was clear that Yazoo represented much more than just the latest pop band, playing as they did with the medias idealised notions of beauty, sexuality and fame: Vince the bleach haired, floppy fringed, part fey part shy anti-lad; Alison with her deep, lustrous voice, oozing a beauty and charm that was all its own.<br /><br />In July 82 the duo released their next single, Dont Go, an up tempo tune where Alisons powerhouse vocals played counterpoint to Vinces distinctive hooklines. The song was another huge hit and offered the perfect introduction to the duos debut album, Upstairs at Erics. Also released in July 82, the album explored the pairs unusual potential to stunning effect. From the raunchy synth funk of Goodbye 70s to the chilling darkness of Winter Kills, it was one of the most complete debut albums to have emerged throughout the decade as a whole, with the cover image of dismembered showroom dummies echoing the musicÕs sense of dislocation from the standard pop formula.<br /><br />Having taken to the road for rapturously received sell out shows, Yazoo consolidated their early success in November 82 with new material appearing in the shape of their next single, The Other Side of Love. Providing the duo with their third hit, the slow, ebbing ambience and oriental melody of its b-side Ode To Boy also offered evidence that the originality of the bands songwriting had not been diminished in the slightest, a fact made clear in April 1983 when the duo released yet another memorable pop classic in the shape of Nobodys Diary.<br /><br />Yet this release was overshadowed by continuing rumours of a split in the Yazoo camp. The duos relationship had become increasingly tense, and in July 83, on the eve of the release of the second album, You and Me Both, they announced they were splitting up. Notwithstanding, the album still entered the the charts in poll position, ably maintaining both critically and commercially the highstandard achieved by Upstairs At Erics.<br /><br />From here Vince and Alison went their separate, yet celebrated ways: Vince joining up with Andy Bell to form the extremely successful partnership ofErasure, whilst Alison forged ahead with her own auspicious solo career. What they left behind them were two remarkable albums and a string of brilliant singles. Though their time together as Yazoo was brief, the impression that Vince and Alison made on contemporary pop music is something far more enduring.<br /><br /></body></html>'),(6,0,'Skinny Puppy','1982','active','ca','Vancouver','Cyberpunk','<html><body><br /><img class=dyn_pic src=bandbilder/skinny.gif /><br /><b>Hemsida:</b><br /><a href=http://www.skinnypuppy.com/>.Skinny Puppy</a><br /><br /><b>Skinny Puppy</b><br />Drawing from the pioneering work of artists like Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire, and Suicide, the dark avant-industrial group Skinny Puppy formed in 1982 in Vancouver, British Columbia. Originally a duo comprised of former Images in Vogue drummer cEvin Key (born Kevin Crompton) and Nivek Ogre(born Kevin Ogilvie), Skinny Puppy followed their debut cassette, Back and Forth, with the EP Remission, the first of many recordings with producer David Rave Ogilvie, in 1984. <br /><br />Keyboardist Wilhelm Schroeder joined the group for 1985s full-length debut,Bites, but was replaced the next year by Dwayne Goettel, whose sampling and synth work proved significant in the development of the Skinny Puppy aesthetic from ominous dance music into a distinct fusion of industrial, goth, and electronic sounds. Subsequent releases like 1986s Mind: The Perpetual Intercourse, 1987s Cleanse, Fold and Manipulate, and 1988s VIVIsectVI further honed the trios style, as well as introducing the outspoken lyrical agenda that remained a thematic constant throughout much of the groups work. <br /><br />In 1989, Ministrys Al Jourgensen added vocals, guitars, and production work to Rabies; later, he joined Ogre in the side project Pigface. Ultimately, the members interest in pursuing similar outside projects began to unravel Skinny Puppy: in 1987, Key and Edward Ka-Spel of the Legendary Pink Dots recorded the album Their Eyes Slowly Burning under the name Tear Garden, and in 1990, he and friend Alan Nelson worked as Hilt. A major rift began splitting the band apart, and Key and Goettel often sided against Ogre, whom they felt was more interested in pursuing solo work than in keeping the trio intact; drugs had also become a serious problem, but Skinny Puppy nonetheless signed to American Recordings in 1993 and relocated to Los Angeles to begin production work. <br /><br />The sessions for the album, titled The Process, proved disastrous; for the first time in nearly a decade, David Ogilvie did not oversee production duties, and the group went through several producers, including former Swan Roli Mosimann and Martin Atkins. Flooding and earthquakes further hampered the sessions, and Key was severely injured in a film shoot. After months of recording, Key and Goettel, dissatisfied with Atkins work, absconded with the master tapes and returned to Vancouver in mid-1994 to finish production.Ogre remained in California, and later announced he was leaving Skinny Puppy to form W.E.L.T. A few months later, on August 23, 1995, Goettel was found dead of a heroin overdose in his parents home; in his honor, Key and Ogilvie finally completed the album, and The Process was released in 1996. A multimedia history of the band, Brap: Back and Forth, Series 3 & 4, followed a few months later, while Key returned to his new project, Download. Released in 1998, Remix Dys Temper featured Skinny Puppy reworkings by Autechre,Neotropic, and Adrian Sherwood in addition to industrial groups like KMFDM and God Lives Underwater. <br /><br />In 2000, Ogre and Key reunited and performed live as Skinny Puppy for the first time since 1992 at the Doomsday Festival in Dresden. This unique concert was professionally filmed and recorded, and while a DVD never materialized, live clips of Testure and Worlock were broadcast on the Crazy Clip Show in Germany and Worlock was included on a VCD compilation by German magazine Sonic Seducer in 2002. The live album Doomsday: Back and Forth Series 5: Live in Dresden was released in 2001. Key joined ohGr (Ogres new band) on drums for its 2001 tour, while Ogre appeared on the track Frozen Sky on Keys 2001 album The Ghost of Each Room. The first new Skinny Puppy track in several years, Optimissed, appeared on the Underworld soundtrack in 2003. Ogre, Key, Mark Walk and various guests, including Danny Carey (Tool) and Wayne Static (Static-X) recorded the new Skinny Puppy album, The Greater Wrong of the Right, released in 2004 on Synthetic Symphony (a sub-label of SPV, their European distributor since the mid-1990s). The new Skinny Puppy sound was in a similar vein as The Process, with a somewhat more rock-oriented style. Pro-Test, the bands first music video since 1996, was rather different than any of their previous video work, featuring a showdown between rival breakdancing/krumping crews.<br /><br />Skinny Puppy toured North America and Europe in support of the album in 2004, joined by William Morrison on guitar and Justin Bennett (ex-Professional Murder Music) on drums. Shows in Toronto and Montreal were filmed for the live DVD Greater Wrong of the Right LIVE, which was released in September 2005. The DVD included Information Warfare, a documentary about the U.S.-led wars in Iraq made by Morrison. The anti-Bush administration stance taken by the band at their live shows drew the ire of PABAAH (Patriotic Americans Boycotting Anti-American Hollywood), which attempted a boycott of college radio stations that played Skinny Puppy. Skinny Puppy toured Europe again in 2005, and returned to the studio to complete their twelfth album, Mythmaker, which was released in January 2007. While some fans longed for the sounds of their earlier days, the band stated their intention to move forward rather than dwell in the past, and played a mixture of new and old material at their shows, including material from the back catalog that had never been performed live before. The bands 2007 North American and European tour, titled Mythrus, began in May 2007. According to a news posting on the official Skinny Puppy website, the bands next studio album is tentatively scheduled to be released in Spring 2009.<br /><br /></body></html> '),(7,0,'Front Line Assembly','1986','active','ca','Vancouver','Cyberpunk','<b>N/A</b> '),(8,0,'Erasure','1985','active','uk','London','Synthpop','<html><body><br /><img class=dyn_pic src=bandbilder/erasure.gif /><br /><b>Hemsida:</b><br /><a href=http://www.erasureinfo.com/>Erasure</a><br /><br /><b>Erasure</b><br />Popgroup from England with songwriter and synth-tech guru Vince Clarke and singer Andy Bell.

Melodihookar som sätter sig som klister på hjärnan. Der Nerv är en synthpopklassiker utan dess like med en gudabenådad melodislinga.','2010-01-06','4','Beg','140'),(18,0,214,'Dare','LP','uk','1981','En album som är en riktig syntpopklassier med dito hiten Dont You Want Me. De låtar som är bra här är ordentligt bra och resten är ok fastän de inte når riktigt lika långt musikaliskt.','2010-01-06','4','Rea','80');
